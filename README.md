# SP2025-FP01-ocean-waves
Final projects repo for the ocean wave/current vs rising global temps analysis

## Group members:
- Molly Bilhartz
- Chandler Bergstrom

- Coastal waves, north shore Honolulu Oahu
- Velocity, wave height, surface water temp, high tide/low tide

## Project Summary:
We want to learn more about how ocean currents form and change and how different water temperatures can affect these currents/waves in different parts of the globe. Possibly contrast the wave patterns of currents near the equator vs those at the poles. Maybe add on how the currents have changed over the years with an increase in average global temperatures.

## Background Information:
Within this project, we will focus on oceanic surface fluid flow, specifically wave patterns off the coast of Honolulu, Hawaii. We will use characteristics such as velocity, wave height, surface water temp, and high/low tide measurements. Wave patterns have been changing over time due to climate change, and we want to be able to graph the data and compare the graphs from each year. From there, we want to predict future patterns and potential changes. 

## Problem Statement:
What are the wave pattern trends over the years and can we predict future wave patterns with data available?


## Data Sets:
- NOAA
- Need to find specifc data sets or merge multiple together because these surface air temp. data sets are only each month, hard to find a year long one let alone a decade of ocean surface air temperature

- Nasa's Earthdata: surface currents 1993-2025, 
- https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/dataset/OSCAR_L4_OC_NRT_V2.0

### Types of Data being collected:
- Global or specific area- air temperature (need to decide if there is a focus area or not)
- Ocean surface temperature (need to decide if there is a focus area or not)
- Ocean current velocities
- Depth measurements of ocean waves
- Current/wave movement patterns (location changes)
- Area of focus- ocean current (below ocean surface) water temperature
  
## Tools/packages being used:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib

## How we will approach the problem:
- We plan to start by pulling air and ocean surface temperature data from public data sites like NOAA, NASA, USGS that we can analyse. 

## Expected results:
We expect there is going to be clear changes in the variables that we used, velocity, wave height, high tide/low tide, air temp, water surface temp, changes, we thinks its gonna change, wave oatterns are going to be be affected by global warming in the trends from years 2000-2020. (find data then change)
