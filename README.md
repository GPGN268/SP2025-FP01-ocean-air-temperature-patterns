# SP2025-FP01-ocean-waves
Final projects repo for the ocean wave/current vs rising global temps analysis

## Group members:
- Molly Bilhartz
- Chandler Bergstrom

## Project Summary:
We want to learn more about how ocean currents form and change and how different water temperatures can affect these currents/waves in different parts of the globe, but our project will focus on the area of Oahu, Hawaii. We'd like to see how ocean wave patterns have changed over the years and if increasing global temperatures have a measureable affect on these waves.

## Background Information:
Within this project, we will focus on oceanic surface fluid flow, specifically wave patterns off the coast of Honolulu, Hawaii. We will use characteristics such as velocity, wave height, surface water temp, and high/low tide measurements. Wave patterns have been changing over time due to climate change, and we want to be able to graph the data and compare the graphs from each year. From there, we want to predict future patterns and potential changes. 

## Problem Statement:
What are the wave pattern trends over the years and can we predict future wave patterns with data available?

## Data Sets:
- NOAA
- Need to find specifc data sets or merge multiple together because these surface air temp. data sets are only each month, hard to find a year long one let alone a decade of ocean surface air temperature

- Nasa's Earthdata: surface currents 1993-2025,

### Types of Data being collected:
- Global air temperatures
- Oahu air temperatures
- Ocean surface temperature 
- Ocean wave velocities
- Depth measurements of ocean waves
- Current/wave movement patterns 
  
## Tools/packages being used:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib

## How we will approach the problem:
- We plan to start by pulling air and ocean surface temperature data from public data sites like NOAA, NASA, USGS that we can analyse then look at differnt types of data for waves in Oahu we can analyse to see if there is a common trend with ocean waves that correlates to rising air temperature trends.

## Expected results:
We expect there is going to be clear changes in the variables that we used, velocity, wave height, high tide/low tide, air temp, water surface temp, changes, we thinks its gonna change, wave oatterns are going to be be affected by global warming in the trends from years 2000-2020. (find data then change)
